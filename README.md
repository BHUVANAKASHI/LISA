# LISA

## LISA Sensitivity Curve Toolkit

This repository contains a custom Python implementation of the **LISA Sensitivity Curve** — a fundamental tool for assessing the detectability of gravitational wave sources using the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). Inspired by the excellent [LISA_Sensitivity project by the Extreme Gravity Institute](https://github.com/eXtremeGravityInstitute/LISA_Sensitivity), this toolkit builds on that work to allow for additional customization and personal analysis.

## Purpose

The primary goals of this project are:

- To compute and visualize the LISA sensitivity curve using analytical models.
- To provide a flexible and modular Python codebase that can be used for educational and research purposes.
- To **store and manage analysis results** involving gravitational wave source detectability using the LISA sensitivity curve.


## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BHUVANAKASHI/LISA.git
cd YOUR_REPO_NAME
````

### 2. Install requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Basic Usage and Results
Please check the test file which clearly showcases the usage and the output plots. For analysis and other codes please check the later repos.
